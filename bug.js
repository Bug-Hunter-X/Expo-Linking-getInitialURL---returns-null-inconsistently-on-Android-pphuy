This error occurs when using the Expo `Linking` API to handle deep links.  The `getInitialURL` method sometimes returns `null` even when a deep link was opened, especially on Android.  This makes it difficult to handle the initial URL and proceed accordingly.  Example:

```javascript
import * as Linking from 'expo-linking';

Linking.getInitialURL().then(url => {
  if (url) {
    // Handle URL
  } else {
    console.log('No initial URL'); // This happens unexpectedly
  }
});
```
